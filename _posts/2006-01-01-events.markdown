<p><b>Description: </b>In this workshop, participants will learn basic mapmaking and cartography using Google Earth Online. The purpose of this workshop is to create simple "Study Area" maps that can be used in papers, presentations, etc without the large learning curve associated with more advanced geospatial software. The workshop will cover simple spatial data creation, the basic principles of cartography, as well as demo story maps, tours, and other Google-specific features. The workshop is designed for users with no GIS experience, however advanced GIS users may find it useful as another possible visualization tool!</p>

<h3>Hand Drawn Maps</h3>
<p><b>Date: </b>10/31/2025</p>
<p><b>Location: </b>DataLab Classroom - room 360 Shields Library</p>
<p><b>Description: </b>In this workshop, we’ll explore drawing maps by hand rather than using digital tools. This skill is useful for helping you as a designer deeply understand an area, but it is also a method of self-expression. The fact that it can be fun should also not be minimized.</p>
<p>After completing this workshop, learners should be able to:

Explain why drawing maps by hand is beneficial and when to use this format over digital methods, Implement a workflow for drawing maps by hand, Design cartographic elements for their maps, Find and use reference materials</p>
<p><b>Concepts Covered: </b>Cartography, analog maps</p>
<p><b>Speaker: </b>Michele Tobias, DataLab</p>
<p>Michele Tobias is a geospatial data scientist with a background in geospatial methods for ecology. Michele earned her PhD from UC Davis in Geography where she studied California’s sandy beach ecosystem with traditional phytosociological methods and innovative remote sensing tools and was a postdoc at the UC Davis Information Center for the Environment. In her current position as a geospatial data scientist at UC Davis DataLab, she applies geospatial tools to new avenues of research across disciplines.</p>
<p><b>Prerequisites: </b>Participants need no previous experience to participate</p>
<p><b>Software Required: </b>The following materials are recommended to fully participate in this workshop:</p>

<p>Paper (at least 2 sheets)</p>
<p>Pencils</p>
<p>A sharpener if you’re using a wood pencil</p>

If you are new to R or would like to brush up on your skills, the <a href="https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_r_basics/">DataLab R Basics Reader</a> is a great place to start. It also assumes you are familiar with GIS concepts like vectors, rasters, coordinate reference systems etc, which is covered in <a href=" https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/Intro-to-Desktop-GIS-with-QGIS/">Next Steps in QGIS</a>.</p>
<p><b>Software Required: </b>Bring a laptop with <a href="https://ftp.osuosl.org/pub/cran/">R</a> and <a href="https://posit.co/downloads/">R Studio</a> installed. These are free and open source. R is a programming language and R Studio is a tool made by Posit that makes writing R code easier.</p>
