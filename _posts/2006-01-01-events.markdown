<p>By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:</p>

<p>Define GIS and geospatial concepts and terminology.</p>
<p>Know the difference between vector and raster data types</p>
<p>Properly connect and add data to a QGIS project</p>
<p>Know where to find the attributes of your data in QGIS</p>
<p>Perform basic selections and queries in QGIS</p>
<p>Symbolize data by attributes</p>
<p>Assemble a basic map for export</p>

<p><b>Concepts Covered:</b> Graphical User Interface GIS; Vector Data; Raster Data; Data Visualization; QGIS</p>

<h3>UCD Map Room & Air Photo Collection</h3>

<p><b>Date:</b> 1/31/2024 @ 10:00-12:00 </p>

<p><b>Location:</b>Shields Library Map Room - lower level (basement) of Shields Library</p>

<p><b>Description:</b> UC Davis has an extensive print map and aerial photography collection. We focus on collecting maps representing the American west and our local region, but we have materials from all over the world. Currently, access to the Map Room is by-appointment-only and #maptimeDavis has an appointment to explore the Map Room on this day. In this session, Librarian David Michalski will show us how to find materials, how to remove maps from their drawers safely, and be available to answer questions about the materials. We'll also have lots of time to just explore the collection and look at maps. Photography of the materials is welcome, but we'll ask you to leave any food and beverages near the entrance to protect the materials.</p>

<p>By the end of this session, participants will know how to use the UC Davis Library Catalog to find maps and aerial photographs, how to access individual items, and best practices for working with the physical collection in the Map Room.</p>

<p><b>Concepts Covered:</b> Print Maps; Aerial Photographs</p>

<p><b>Speaker:</b> David Michalski</p>

<p>David Michalski is the Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences Librarian. He has a master’s degree in library and information science from SUNY Queens, and a Ph.D. in cultural studies from UC Davis.</p>
