<p>This schedule is current as of 1/7/2025.</p>

<p>Workshops take place on <b>Fridays from 10:00-12:00</b>, unless otherwise indicated. Please note the location of each workshop. In-person workshops will typically be held in <b><a href="http://campusmap.ucdavis.edu/?b=115">The Physical and Data Sciences Building, previously known as PSEL (Physical Sciences & Engineering Library),</a> Seminar Room (room 1025)</b>. Most of our workshops will be fully in-person with no zoom option. We anticipate making videos of instructional workshops available on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@maptimedavis95616">YouTube Channel</a> after the end of the quarter for those who are unable to attend in person.</p>

<p>Where is the <a href="http://campusmap.ucdavis.edu/?b=115">The Physical and Data Sciences Building, previously known as PSEL (Physical Sciences & Engineering Library)</a> Seminar Room (room 1025) inside the building? From the front doors, walk straight forward, past the long bank of conference tables, and you'll see the room on your left.</p>

<h3>Community Work Sessions</h3>

<p><b>Date:</b> 7/11/2015 - 8/29/2025, Fridays @ 10:00-12:00</p>

<p><b>Location:</b> Physical and Data Sciences Building (formerly Physical Sciences & Engineering Library/PSEL), Seminar Room 1025</p>

<p><b>Description:</b> People working with geospatial data and methods are scattered across campus. Wouldn’t it be nice to work on your geospatial projects around peers who actually understand what you’re doing? Come work in the same space with other geo people, get feedback, ask questions, and answer questions. Over the summer, we'll be organizing topic-focused sub-groups for people to learn specific skills in small groups, but folks are always welcome to come work on their own projects.</p>

<p><b>Speaker:</b>Michele Tobias, DataLab</p>
<p>Michele Tobias is a geospatial data scientist with a background in geospatial methods for ecology. Michele earned her PhD from UC Davis in Geography where she studied California’s sandy beach ecosystem with traditional phytosociological methods and innovative remote sensing tools and was a postdoc at the UC Davis Information Center for the Environment. In her current position as a geospatial data scientist at UC Davis DataLab, she applies geospatial tools to new avenues of research across disciplines.</p>
<p><b>Prerequisites:</b>Participants need no previous experience to participate</p>

<h3>Intro to GIS in R</h3>
<p><b>Date:</b>11/14/2025</p>
<p><b>Location:</b>The Physical and Data Sciences Building, previously known as PSEL (Physical Sciences & Engineering Library) Seminar Room (room 1025)</p>
<p><b>Description:</b>Intro to GIS in R is a workshop designed to get you started doing Geographic Information Science (GIS) in R. It is, roughly speaking, the R version of <a href=" https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/Intro-to-Desktop-GIS-with-QGIS/">Next Steps in QGIS</a>. We will cover setting up R for GIS, getting data in and out of R, data transformation, filtering, and geoprocessing tools, as well as some basic mapping.</p>
<p><b>Concepts Covered:</b></p>
<p><b>Speaker:</b></p>
<p>Elise Hellwig is a Research Data Scientist at the UC Davis DataLab. She has her masters in Agricultural Ecology and has worked on a wide variety of projects from database management, to environmental justice mapping, to text analysis.</p>
<p><b>Prerequisites:</b>This workshop assumes you have some experience with R. If you are new to R or would like to brush up on your skills, the <a href="https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/workshop_r_basics/">DataLab R Basics Reader</a> is a great place to start. It also assumes you are familiar with GIS concepts like vectors, rasters, coordinate reference systems etc, which is covered in <a href=" https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/Intro-to-Desktop-GIS-with-QGIS/">Next Steps in QGIS</a>.</p>
