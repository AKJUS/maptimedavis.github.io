<p>This schedule is current as of 1/7/2025.</p>

<p>Workshops take place on <b>Fridays from 10:00-12:00</b>, unless otherwise indicated. Please note the location of each workshop. In-person workshops will typically be held in <b><a href="http://campusmap.ucdavis.edu/?b=115">The Physical and Data Sciences Building, previously known as PSEL (Physical Sciences & Engineering Library),</a> Seminar Room (room 1025)</b>. Most of our workshops will be fully in-person with no zoom option. We anticipate making videos of instructional workshops available on our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@maptimedavis95616">YouTube Channel</a> after the end of the quarter for those who are unable to attend in person.</p>

<p>Where is the <a href="http://campusmap.ucdavis.edu/?b=115">The Physical and Data Sciences Building, previously known as PSEL (Physical Sciences & Engineering Library)</a> Seminar Room (room 1025) inside the building? From the front doors, walk straight forward, past the long bank of conference tables, and you'll see the room on your left.</p>

<h3>Work Session</h3>

<p><b>Date:</b> 4/11/2025 @ 10:00-12:00</p>

<p><b>Location:</b> Physical and Data Sciences Building (formerly Physical Sciences & Engineering Library/PSEL), Seminar Room 1025</p>

<p><b>Description:</b> People working with geospatial data and methods are scattered across campus. Wouldn’t it be nice to work on your geospatial projects around peers who actually understand what you’re doing? Come work in the same space with other geo people, get feedback, ask questions, and answer questions.</p>

<p><b>Speaker:</b> Community Event</p>

<p><b>RSVP:</b> Let us know you’re planning to attend with our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScHMZF-hPnY3J6T0NAbkrGBxjP0Xsw1wwhJftdHBklnXiq3sg/viewform?usp=header">RSVP Form</a></p>

<h3>Hand Drawn Maps</h3>
<p><b>Date:</b>4/18/2025 10:00-12:00</p>
<p><b>Location:</b>The Physical and Data Sciences Building, previously known as PSEL (Physical Sciences & Engineering Library) Seminar Room (room 1025)</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> In this workshop, we’ll explore drawing maps by hand rather than using digital tools. This skill is useful for helping you as a designer deeply understand an area, but it is also a method of self-expression. The fact that it can be fun should also not be minimized. </p>
<p>"After completing this chapter, learners should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain why drawing maps by hand is beneficial and when to use this format over digital methods</li>
<li>Implement a workflow for drawing maps by hand</li>
<li>Design cartographic elements for their maps</li>
<li>Find and use reference materials</li>
<ul>
<p><b>Concepts Covered:</b> Cartography, analog maps </p>
<p><b>Speaker:</b> Michele Tobias, DataLab </p>
<p>Michele Tobias is a geospatial data scientist with a background in geospatial methods for ecology. Michele earned her PhD from UC Davis in Geography where she studied California’s sandy beach ecosystem with traditional phytosociological methods and innovative remote sensing tools and was a postdoc at the UC Davis Information Center for the Environment. In her current position as a geospatial data scientist at UC Davis DataLab, she applies geospatial tools to new avenues of research across disciplines.</p>
<p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Participants need no previous experience to participate </p>
<p>The following materials are recommended to fully participate in this workshop:</p>
<ul>
<li>Paper (at least 2 sheets)</li>
<li>Pencils</li>
<li>A sharpener if you’re using a wood pencil</li>
<li>Eraser (bigger than the one that comes on the back of your pencil)</li>
<li>Pens</li>
<li>Colored pencils, marker, or crayons (optional)</li>
<li>A device with internet access to look up reference materials</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Location:</b>The Physical and Data Sciences Building, previously known as PSEL (Physical Sciences & Engineering Library) Seminar Room (room 1025)</p>
<p><b>Description:</b> In this workshop, we'll build on the concepts we learned in the workshop "Intro to GIS with QGIS".  This workshop will cover additional analysis tools and methods for spatial data in QGIS that provide the base skills needed for further geospatial research. </p>
<p>Learn additional tools and methods for spatial analysis in QGIS including spatial joins, clips, buffers, and merges. </p>
<p><b>Concepts Covered:</b> QGIS, Desktop GIS, Spatial Analysis </p>
<p><b>Speaker:</b> Lauren Mabe, Geography Graduate Group </p>
<p>Lauren is a PhD Candidate in the Geography Graduate Group and previously worked as a cartographer for Garmin Intl. Her research focuses on sustainable organic waste management systems in California. She uses many geospatial tools in her work and is passionate about good maps in research!</p>
<p><b>Prerequisites:</b> Attendees should be comfortable with loading vector and raster data into QGIS.  To prepare, attendees can work through the "Intro to GIS with QGIS" workshop materials at https://ucdavisdatalab.github.io/Intro-to-Desktop-GIS-with-QGIS/ </p>
<p><b>Software:</b> Download and install QGIS on your laptop. QGIS is free, open source, and runs on all major computer operating systems. https://qgis.org/</p>
