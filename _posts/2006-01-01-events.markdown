<h3>Community Work Sessions</h3>

<p><b>Date:</b> 7/11/2015 - 8/29/2025, Fridays @ 10:00-12:00</p>

<p><b>Location:</b> Physical and Data Sciences Building (formerly Physical Sciences & Engineering Library/PSEL), Seminar Room 1025</p>

<p><b>Description:</b> People working with geospatial data and methods are scattered across campus. Wouldn’t it be nice to work on your geospatial projects around peers who actually understand what you’re doing? Come work in the same space with other geo people, get feedback, ask questions, and answer questions. Over the summer, we'll be organizing topic-focused sub-groups for people to learn specific skills in small groups, but folks are always welcome to come work on their own projects.</p>
